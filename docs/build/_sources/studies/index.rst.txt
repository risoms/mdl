Although negatively biased attention has a central theoretical and empirical role in the maintenance of depression, 
there are few behavioral treatments that successfully target and improve this deficit. The current proposal builds upon 
our prior work and aims to further develop an attention bias modification intervention. We propose to develop a highly 
specific intervention that directly targets negative attention bias and the neurobiology that supports it, using cutting-edge 
cognitive neuroscience to inform treatment development and improve quality of life of patients whose psychopathology is 
maintained by negative attention bias.

Cognitive models of depression suggest depression is associated with negatively biased attention, a potential risk and maintenance 
factor. Previous studies utilizing the emotional variant of the dot-probe task have shown that depressed individuals selectively 
attend to negative stimuli. In recent years, researchers have begun exploring the potential of online, web-based platforms 
for use in psychological research, either on their own or to supplement more traditional forms of data collection. These 
online platforms have distinct advantages, as they allow researchers to sample a much larger population than would normally 
be available to them in more naturalistic settings. However, eye tracking studies have generally involved expensive, 
specialized equipment, and have been largely restricted to laboratories and highly controlled settings. The current study 
sought to investigate the potential of WebGazer.js, an online eye tracker that utilizes participant's webcams, to collect 
behavioral and gaze data related to a dot-probe task.
